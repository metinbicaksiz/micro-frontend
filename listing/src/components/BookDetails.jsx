      "Jorgie longed to escape the cluster of thieving misfits she’d called friends for most of her life. She’d outgrown her past and needed a new beginning. So, she ran away from everything and everyone she’d ever known, with no real plan. But no matter how far she ran, the thrill of mischief was still in her heart. It boiled through her blood. After all, could a person really change that much?  On a whim, Jorgie found herself alone and headed to the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Where else could she blend in more anonymously? And there were so many sparkly and priceless collectibles known to be on display at this once-in-a-lifetime event. It was too easy, too fun, too tempting. It was the dawn of a new day. She had her eye on the Blue Pendant of Aldovia and no one could stop her. That is until someone did. And that is where the mystery begins.",

      "The year is 1820 and the town is called Luna. Twin brothers, once fiercely at odds, come together to unwind knotted secrets buried in the town’s menacing past. This quaint southern town, with its gentile and prosperous people, is not what it appears to be on the surface. Or is it? As the mysteries unfold, the brothers learn much about themselves, their destinies, and their capacities for change.  But will they have the fortitude to do what is expected of them? And can they save the future of the town and the lives of the many people who call it home?",
